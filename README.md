A simple solution to missing DLL files errors that worked for me.

Just move [this files](https://github.com/1RaY-1/win-fix-missing-dll-errors/tree/main/dlls) to `C:\Windows\System32`, restart your pc and see if it solved the problem.

If you think [this files](https://github.com/1RaY-1/win-fix-missing-dll-errors/tree/main/dlls) are viruses, just check them with an antivirus (but I checked them already).
